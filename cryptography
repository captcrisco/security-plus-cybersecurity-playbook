   Asymmetric encryption is a public-key encryption that uses a pair of keys, public and private. The public key is used for encryption and sends the encryption
 to the public while the private key is held on the decryption side so the only person that can decrypt it is the person with the private key. The keys 
 are mathematically paired. 

    Symmetric encryption is where two people or devices have the same secret key to encrypt and decrypt data. Both people or devices would need to keep
the symmetric encryption a secret and would have to get the keys to both people or devices in a sucure matter where they wouldnt be open to threat actors. 

    Hashing is the process that transforms data into a fixed string that hides and keeps data from being easily read. The hash usually is for sensitive data 
 like passwords. Hash are a one way function meaning you cant retrieve the original input from the hash output.   

    MD5 hasing is acryptographic hash function that produces a 128-bit hash value, typically represented as a 32-character hexadecimal number. No matter the 
size of the data it always puts a 128 bit hash

    SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm) refers to a family of cryptographic hash functions designed to provide data integrity and security. Unlike MD5, SHA algorithms 
produce hash values of varying lengths (224, 256, 384, or 512 bits), depending on the specific version used. SHA is widely used in digital signatures, certificates, 
and various security protocols due to its stronger security compared to MD5.  SHA, with SHA-1, SHA-256, and SHA-512

    bcrypt is a cryptographic hash function specifically designed for securely hashing passwords. It is based on the Blowfish cipher and includes a built-in key
strengthening mechanism, which makes it much more resistant to brute-force attacks compared to simpler hash functions like MD5 and SHA. bcrypt is widely
used for securely storing passwords in modern applications. bcrypt uses salt and key stretching.
