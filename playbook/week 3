Under Hands on project 5-2 I learned about the importance of windows security options. 
I was able to see when and what was updated on my computer. Also showing how to protect
personal information in folders to lock them from threat actors.

Under hands on project 5-6 I learned the basic prevention advice which is a helpful
reminder in which to consider when using the internet. I also learned about websites 
can hand help identify or give me keys to ransomware. These are great preventive tools 
and are great for helping and gathering iformation on ransomware. 

Under hands on project 6-1 I learned about QR codes. How easy it is to create QR codes
and the importance on how dangerous they can be. They can show anything from websites and
locations. If Threat actors get a hold of some and can change the code they could lead 
you to some malware. They are also great phishing tools for malware. 

under hands on project 6-2 I learned about windows and apples update content on 
vulnerablities. These files were great in showing what they updated, why they updated
and what to look out for before these updates. They are great for information in what
threats are out there and what threats can look like. It can be a lot to look at but 
the information is helpful.
