access. This is to give a little extra security when loggin into secure information like banking information.

loggin into that banking site. 

Biometrics is another added security that uses something that is you for accessing places or devices. 
These can be eye scanners or fignerprints that are unique for a individuale. 

Password Policies are a guidline when making a new password. These guidlines make your passwords more 
secure from attacks. They often make you create a more complex less hackable password, these often make 
you use a mix of numbers, lower case and uppercase letters, and some characters.
