1 Timestamp: Logs typically begin with a timestamp indicating when the event occurred. Look for the time and date format to help with correlation across logs.

2 Log Level: Logs usually have a severity level (e.g., INFO, WARN, ERROR, DEBUG). Higher-severity levels (ERROR, CRITICAL) are more important for troubleshooting.

3 Source IP/Hostname: Identify the device or application generating the log. It may include IP addresses, hostnames, or process IDs.

4 Event/Message: The core message describes the event. Look for keywords, actions, and error messages that provide context.

5 Read Logs Chronologically

6 Review logs in chronological order to see the sequence of events leading up to the issue.

7 Pay attention to events that occurred right before or after the issue (e.g., service crashes, unauthorized access attempts).
