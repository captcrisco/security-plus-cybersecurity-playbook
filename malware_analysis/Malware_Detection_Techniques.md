Methods of detecting malware can be signature detection, static analysis, dynamic analysis, behavioral analysis, and application allowlisting. 

Signature detecti
on uses known digital indicators to identify suspicious behaviours. This is an antivirus software that has a list of known signatures of malware 
and will watch for the signature match and will black known malware. The downside is it can only detect known attacks. 

Static analysis analyzes a suspicious executable without running it. This will analyze and examine the file structure and identify strings.
Breaking down into code analysts can study the malware and determine its purpose.  Tools used can be Exeinfo, PEstudio, Strings, UPX, and Get-FileHash.

Dynamic  analysis executes malware within a controlled environment to observe its behavior in real time. These programs that are in question
can be run in a virtual program like a sandbox to not harm the device. 

Behavioral analysis observes and interacts with malware in a sample lab, this helps study the malware behavior and its capabilities and potential 
impact. They are used in a sandbox type program.

Application analysis tries to trace malware back to its origin and its potential threats. Examines the code and combines static and dynamic
analysis to extract the most information about the malware. Programs like Ghidra decompiled code into human readable output.
